- **I love three things in the world, the sun, the moon and you. The sun for day, the moon for the night, and you forever**

  浮世三千，吾爱有三。日，月与卿。日为朝，月为暮，卿为朝朝暮暮。

- **Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.(怦然心动)**

  有人住高楼,有人在深沟,有人光万丈,有人一身锈,世人万千种,浮云莫去求,斯人若彩虹,遇上方知有
