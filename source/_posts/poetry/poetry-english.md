- **I love three things in the world, the sun, the moon and you. The sun for day, the moon for the night, and you forever**

  浮世三千，吾爱有三。日，月与卿。日为朝，月为暮，卿为朝朝暮暮。

- **Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.(怦然心动)**

  有人住高楼,有人在深沟,有人光万丈,有人一身锈,世人万千种,浮云莫去求,斯人若彩虹,遇上方知有

- If he likes cake, he will not like you, even if you're the best chocolate. But always remember, to be the best of yourself, the right person will like you. 

  也对
  自己是梧桐，凤凰才会来栖，自己是大海，百川才来汇聚
  花香自有蝶舞来，日子没到强求又何必
  做全世界最棒的巧克力，你自然会碰见来自四面八方的巧克力爱好者。
